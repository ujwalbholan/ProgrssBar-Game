# ProgrssBar-Game
The Progress Bar Game is a time-based challenge where players must prevent progress bars from reaching 0%.
The progress bars start at 100% and decrease gradually over time.
The player's objective is to click or interact with the progress bars to refill them.
If any progress bar reaches 0%, the game is lost.
